    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p class="p1">Web development involves creating and maintaining websites. It encompasses tasks such as designing the layout, building user interfaces, writing code for the website's functionality, and ensuring optimal performance. Web development is divided into two main areas: front-end development, which focuses on the visual aspects and user experience, and back-end development, which handles server-side processes, databases, and application logic. Modern web development often uses languages and frameworks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Django to build responsive, interactive, and user-friendly websites.</p>
